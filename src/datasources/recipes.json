      "preparation": "1. Begin by preparing the chicken breasts. Rinse them under cold running water and pat them dry with a paper towel. Season them generously with salt and pepper on both sides.\n2. In a shallow dish, add the flour and dredge the chicken breasts, making sure to coat them evenly.\n3. Heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat until the butter has melted and is sizzling.\n4. Add the chicken breasts to the skillet and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from skillet and set aside.\n5. Add the chicken broth, white wine, lemon juice, lemon zest, and thyme to the skillet. Stir to combine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.\n6. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for about 5 minutes, until the sauce has reduced slightly and thickened.\n7. Add the chicken breasts back to the skillet and spoon the sauce over them. Simmer for another 5-7 minutes, until the chicken is heated through and the sauce has thickened even more.\n8. Serve the chicken on a platter, garnished with fresh thyme leaves and lemon slices. Drizzle the remaining sauce over the top and serve hot.\n",
